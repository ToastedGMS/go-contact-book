# Go Contact Book

This is a project I'm using to learn the Go language. It started off as a CLI tool, and the plan is to turn it into a backend http server with database connections and online deployment. The goal here is to learn Golang at least to a basic level.

## Features Implemented (So Far)

- Implement fully working contact writing, reading and lookup via CLI arguments (deprecated)
- Implement JSON file storage for contact persistence
- Implement all CRUD operations related to contacts
- Implement RESTFUL endpoints for executing CRUD operations
- Implement Repository Pattern to better handle Separation of Concerns between application layers
- (We are here) Implementing unit tests for service layer functions
